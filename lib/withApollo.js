/****
 * PrismicLink is the only differing dependency from what Next-with-Apollo requested.
 * I've basically put in all the required dependencies here in a sort of hybrid way.
 * I know not the best explanation, but that's because I don't understand it that well myself
 * yet.....
 *
 * I'm not super sure which documentation to follow right now. What I've done so far is this....
 * I've applied Next-with-Apollo, and then applied the PrismicLink to it: https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-with-apollo
 * My problem is that I'm not sure whether or not we need a prismic-configuration.js file in the root like this documentation is specifying: https://prismic.io/docs/reactjs/getting-started/prismic-nextjs
 *
 * I guess really what I need to know is whether I need to also set it up so so that Next and Prismic play nice, or just Apollo and Prismic do.
 *
 *
 *
 * I think I might need to configure Next with Prismic, the same way I configured Next with Apollo.....
 * OMG Idk what to do ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯ğŸ¤¯
